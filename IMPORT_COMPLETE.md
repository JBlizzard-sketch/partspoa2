-- Total products: 653
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;

-- Products per category (all properly distributed)
SELECT c.name, COUNT(p.id) 
FROM categories c 
LEFT JOIN products p ON c.id = p.category_id 
GROUP BY c.name;
```

## üéØ Critical Fix Applied

**For Future Agents**: The `scripts/setup.ts` file now correctly imports from `generated-seed-data.ts` instead of `seed-data.ts`. This ensures all 653 products are seeded on fresh imports, not just 15.

This fix has been documented in:
- `scripts/setup.ts` (line 3)
- `replit.md` (Quick Start Guide section)
- `replit-documentation/00-START-HERE.md` (Fresh Import Setup section)
