## 📋 Quick Start (For Next Agent)

When you start, run these commands to verify everything:

```bash
# Check server is running
curl http://localhost:5000/api/categories | head -50

# If not running, restart workflow
# Workflow will auto-restart after package changes
```

**DO NOT** run `npm install` or `npm run setup` again unless you have a fresh import.

## 🚧 What Agent 8 Is Building (Current Session)

### Priority 1: Performance Optimization
**Goal**: Fix slow loading issues  
**Implementation**:
- Converting all images to Next.js Image component
- Adding lazy loading for below-the-fold content
- Implementing loading skeletons for better UX
- Code splitting for heavy components

### Priority 2: Checkout Flow (Payment Stub)
**Goal**: Complete checkout with "WhatsApp fallback" message  
**Location**: `/checkout`  
**Features**:
- Full checkout form (shipping address, contact info)
- M-Pesa and Bank transfer payment options (visual only)
- On submit: Show message "Payment integration temporarily unavailable. Please WhatsApp us at +254 700 000 000"
- Save order to database with status "pending_whatsapp"

### Priority 3: Seller System (Stub)
**Goal**: Sellers can register but get "under review" message  
**Locations**:
- `/seller/register` - Registration form
- `/seller/dashboard` - Dashboard showing "under review" status

**Implementation**:
- Comprehensive registration form (business details, KRA PIN, product categories)
- On submit: "Thank you! We'll review and contact you in 2-3 days"
- Dashboard shows application status and preview of future features

### Priority 4: Blog Section + 5 SEO Articles
**Goal**: Content marketing and SEO  
**Location**: `/blog`  
**Articles** (800-1000 words each):
1. "Top 10 Essential Car Parts Every Kenyan Driver Should Know"
2. "How to Choose Quality Auto Parts in Kenya: Complete Guide"
3. "Surviving Nairobi Traffic: Maintenance Tips for Your Car"
4. "New vs Used Auto Parts: What's Best for Your Budget?"
5. "Common Car Problems in Kenya and How to Fix Them"

Each article includes:
- SEO-optimized content with keywords
- Stock images (automotive themed)
- Internal links to products
- Proper meta tags

### Priority 5: Informational Pages
**Pages being created**:
- `/about` - Company story with stock images
- `/contact` - Contact form + WhatsApp button
- `/faq` - Common questions
- `/shipping-returns` - Policies
- `/terms` - Terms and conditions
- `/privacy` - Privacy policy

All pages include relevant stock images and are fully responsive.

### Priority 6: Authentication UI (No Backend)
**Pages**: `/login`, `/register`, `/forgot-password`  
**Note**: These are UI only. Forms don't actually authenticate yet - they'll show "Coming soon" or redirect to contact.

### Priority 7: Visual Polish
**UI Improvements**:
- Flashier design with animations and hover effects
- Better typography and spacing
- Stock images throughout
- Trust signals (testimonials, guarantees)
- Modern color scheme with gradients

### Priority 8: SEO Optimization
**Implementation**:
- Meta tags for all pages
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- JSON-LD structured data for products
- Sitemap.xml generation
- robots.txt
- Canonical URLs

### Priority 9: Link Fixing
**Goal**: Ensure every button/link goes somewhere (no dead ends)

## 🚨 CRITICAL: What NOT to Do

### ❌ NEVER Run These Commands
```bash
npm run db:push          # Causes SSL errors
drizzle-kit push         # Same issue
npm install              # Unless fresh import
npm run setup            # Database already seeded
```

### ❌ NEVER Modify These Files
- `server/db.ts` - SSL configuration is correct, don't touch
- `drizzle.config.ts` - Database config is working
- `.env` files - Replit manages environment variables

### ❌ NEVER Upgrade These (Yet)
- Next.js (13.5.1 → 15.x) - Breaking changes, not worth it now
- React (18.2.0 → 19.x) - Same reason
- Focus on features first, upgrade later if needed

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables (Auto-Set)

These are automatically configured by Replit:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@helium/heliumdb?sslmode=disable
PGHOST=helium
PGPORT=5432
PGUSER=postgres
PGPASSWORD=[auto-set]
PGDATABASE=heliumdb
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dbwfl1ii3
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=911652142561656
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=0Yxe4Sz55uwxN_S-CSLOs90f_gE
```

**You never need to set these manually.**

---

## 💡 Design Principles

### User-Centered
- **Target**: Kenyan car owners and mechanics
- **Primary device**: Mobile (Kenya is mobile-first)
- **Connection**: Often slower, optimize accordingly
- **Preferred contact**: WhatsApp (not email)

### Business Model
- **Current**: Browse and WhatsApp to order
- **Future**: Full e-commerce with M-Pesa
- **Sellers**: Can register, admin approves
- **Trust signals**: Important for online marketplace in Kenya

### Visual Style
- **Colors**: Blue (trust), Yellow (energy), professional
- **Typography**: Clear, readable on mobile
- **Images**: High quality, real products
- **Animations**: Subtle, not distracting

## 🛠️ Common Tasks

# - Add metadata export for SEO
# - Make it responsive (mobile-first)
# - Include stock images if informational
# - Add proper navigation links
```

### Add a New API Endpoint

# Create route file
touch app/api/endpoint-name/route.ts

# Use Drizzle ORM for database queries
# Return JSON responses
# Handle errors properly
```

### Use Stock Images
```typescript
// Use the stock_image_tool
// Save images to public/stock/
// Reference in components
import Image from 'next/image'
<Image src="/stock/image-name.jpg" alt="..." width={800} height={600} />
```

---

## 📊 Database Schema

### Tables
1. **categories** - 8 records (Engine, Body, Electrical, etc.)
2. **products** - 15 records (all with Cloudinary images)
3. **users** - 0 records (ready for auth)
4. **cart_items** - 0 records (using localStorage for now)
5. **wishlist** - 0 records (using localStorage for now)
6. **reviews** - 0 records (ready for feature)
7. **orders** - Ready for checkout implementation

---

2. **Performance matters** - Kenya has slower connections, optimize everything
3. **WhatsApp is king** - Use it as fallback for everything
4. **Mobile-first is mandatory** - Desktop is secondary
5. **Stub smartly** - Build UI for features, implement backend later
6. **SEO is critical** - Needed for organic traffic in competitive market
