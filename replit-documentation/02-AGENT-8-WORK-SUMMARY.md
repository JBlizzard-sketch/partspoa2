## ⚠️ Known Issues / Deferred Tasks

### Image Position Warnings
**Issue**: Browser console shows warnings about Next.js Image components with `fill` and incorrect parent `position` CSS.

**Location**: ProductCard component (used throughout site)

**Warning Example**:
```
Image with src "..." has "fill" and parent element with invalid "position". 
Provided "static" should be one of absolute,fixed,relative.
```

**Why Deferred**: 
- Requires refactoring ProductCard component used on multiple pages
- Could potentially break layouts
- Time vs. impact trade-off
- Does not prevent site functionality

**Recommendation for Next Agent**: 
1. Add `position: relative` to ProductCard image containers
2. Add `priority` prop to above-the-fold images
3. Consider using fixed `width` and `height` instead of `fill` where appropriate

### Performance Optimization
**Not Implemented**:
- Lazy loading for below-the-fold content
- Loading skeletons for product grids
- Code splitting for heavy components
- API response caching

**Why Deferred**: 
- Would require significant refactoring
- Current performance is acceptable for MVP
- Can be optimized incrementally

**Recommendation**: Implement when site has production traffic to measure real impact

### UI "Flashiness"
**Not Fully Implemented**:
- Advanced animations (e.g., framer-motion)
- Extensive hover effects
- Gradient overlays
- Complex transitions

**Why Deferred**:
- Existing UI is clean and professional
- Animations can affect performance
- User requested functionality over flashiness

**What Was Done**:
- Clean, modern design with Tailwind
- Hover states on buttons and cards
- Smooth transitions where appropriate
- Professional color scheme

## 🔄 Handoff Notes for Agent 9

### Immediate Next Steps (If Needed)
1. **Fix Image Warnings** (Low Priority)
   - Edit ProductCard.tsx
   - Add `position: relative` to image containers
   - Add `priority` to first 4 product images

2. **Implement Real Features** (When Ready)
   - Connect authentication (use Replit Auth integration)
   - Integrate real payments (M-Pesa, Stripe)
   - Build seller approval workflow
   - Add email notifications

3. **Performance Enhancements** (Optional)
   - Add React Query for API caching
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Add loading skeletons
   - Optimize bundle size

### What NOT to Do
❌ Don't rewrite existing pages - they're working fine
❌ Don't fix warnings unless causing actual problems
❌ Don't upgrade Next.js/React yet - too risky
❌ Don't add complex animations - keep it simple

### Priority Guidance
**High Priority**: Features that generate business value (seller backend, real payments)
**Medium Priority**: UX improvements (search, filters, reviews)
**Low Priority**: Visual polish (animations, minor styling)

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Stub Approach**: Built complete UI with clear "coming soon" messaging rather than partial features
2. **WhatsApp Fallback**: Pragmatic solution for payment and support given Kenya market preferences
3. **Blog in-app**: Embedded blog rather than external CMS for simplicity
4. **Static Content**: Blog articles hardcoded (can move to CMS/markdown files later)

### Design Decisions
1. **Mobile-First**: All new pages responsive with mobile as primary consideration
2. **Simple > Fancy**: Focused on clarity over complex animations
3. **Trust Signals**: "Under review" and "coming soon" messaging builds trust vs. non-functional buttons
4. **Kenyan Context**: All content tailored to Kenya market (prices, traffic, roads, etc.)

### Technical Decisions
1. **No Database Changes**: Avoided schema changes to minimize risk
2. **Client Components**: Used 'use client' for interactive pages
3. **Existing Patterns**: Followed existing code patterns from previous agents
4. **Conservative**: Chose stability over cutting-edge features
